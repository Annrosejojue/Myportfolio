    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/Ann.png" alt="Ann Rose" class="profile-pic"/>
    <p>
      I’m Ann Rose Edakkalathur a backend developer, AI enthusiast, and data science specialist with a passion for building technology that solves real-world problems. My journey began in Kerala, India, where I grew up surrounded by stories of resilience and innovation. That early exposure to community-driven problem-solving sparked a lifelong curiosity about how systems work and how they can work better for people.
    </p>
    <p>
      After earning my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University (2018–2022), I joined <a href="https://www.infosys.com/" target="_blank">Infosys</a> as a System Engineer (2022–2024). There, I led backend development for healthcare and smart city platforms, engineered scalable APIs, and delivered zero-downtime solutions using Microsoft Power Platform. My work improved operational efficiency and citizen engagement, and taught me that every line of code carries impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.mercy.edu/" target="_blank">Mercy University</a> (2024–2025), specializing in AI and Data Science. As a Teaching Assistant, I mentor students in Python and algorithm design a role that’s deepened my technical thinking and strengthened my communication skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical toolkit includes Java, Python, SQL, R, Azure, AWS, MongoDB, Tableau, and tools like GitHub, Postman, and Power Automate. I’m certified in Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900), Azure Administrator (AZ-104), Azure AI (AI-900), and Infosys SQL Professional. I’ve built predictive models, automated workflows, and deployed full-stack applications with secure authentication and real-time features.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring not just technical depth, but strategic thinking, collaboration, and a deep commitment to ethical innovation. Whether I’m debugging a backend system, mentoring a student, or contributing to a cross-functional team, I lead with empathy and purpose. I’m excited to join a team where I can contribute, grow, and help shape technology that uplifts society.

  <h2>Academic Projects</h2>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Drive Smart – Predictive Vehicle Maintenance</h3>
    <p>
      Developed a machine learning model to predict vehicle maintenance needs based on mileage, age, service history, and technical specifications. Applied advanced preprocessing techniques and feature engineering (e.g., “Days Since Last Service”), and used SMOTE to address class imbalance. After evaluating multiple algorithms, Logistic Regression and SVM achieved ~82% accuracy. The model was deployed as a Flask-based web app for real-time predictions, enabling fleet managers to proactively schedule maintenance, reduce operational costs, and enhance vehicle safety.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>Cancer Detection Using AI</h3>
    <p>
      Designed an AI-powered diagnostic tool for early brain tumor detection using MRI scans. Leveraged Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve over 97% accuracy in classifying tumor vs. non-tumor images. The system incorporated image preprocessing, tumor segmentation, and 3D modeling to provide detailed visualizations for clinical assessment. This project demonstrated how AI can accelerate diagnosis, improve accuracy, and support doctors in making faster, more informed decisions—ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.
